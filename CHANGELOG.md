# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `wfxctl workflow query` now accepts a `sort` param
- Added (existing but undocumented) `/health` and `/version` endpoint to OpenAPI spec
- OpenAPI v3 spec is served at `/api/wfx/v1/openapi.json`
- Add build tags to `--version` output

### Fixed

- `wfx`: implemented sort functionality for `/workflows` endpoint

### Changed

- Migrated from Swagger to OpenAPI v3
- The previous Swagger (OpenAPI v2) specification is still available at `/api/wfx/v1/swagger.json` to _ensure compatibility_ with older clients (e.g., SWUpdate <= 2024.12). This endpoint will be removed in a future release.
- The top-level `/swagger.json` is no longer served, as no known clients make use of it.
- `wfxctl workflow get` uses southbound API by default
- `wfxctl health` validates the certificate chain when using TLS
- Forbbiden requests (e.g. job creation via southbound API) now return HTTP status code 403 instead of 405
- System certificates will be loaded automatically for TLS communication
